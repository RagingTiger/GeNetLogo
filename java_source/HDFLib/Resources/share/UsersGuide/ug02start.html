   <h2>
   <a name="ug02main"></a>2.1 The Main Window</h2>
   <p>
   When you first open HDFView, the HDFView window appears with an empty tree
   and data panel. After you open an HDF file, the structure of the file is displayed
   in the Tree Panel. The content of a data object is displayed in the Data panel
   by opening the data object.</p>
   
   <p>
   The main window consists of five components: <b>Menu bar, Tool bar, File bar,
   Tree panel, Data Panel, Info panel.</b></p>
   
   <center><p>

   <br /><b>The main window</b></p></center>
   
   <ul class="ul">
   <li>
   <b><i>Menu bar</i></b><br />
   The Menu bar is where you choose menu commands: &ldquo;File&rdquo;, 
   &ldquo;Window&rdquo;, &ldquo;Tools&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Help&rdquo;.</li>
   
   <li>
   <b><i>Tool bar</i></b><br />
   The Tool bar is located under the menu bar and displays buttons with icons that are shortcuts for commonly performed
   tasks, such as opening and closing a file, zooming in or out of an image, or
   flipping forward and backward through data pages.</li>
   
   <li>
   <b><i>File bar</i></b><br />
   The File bar consists of a Recent Files button which allows you to select among a
   list of files that you have recently opened. In addition to this is a File/URL text 
   field in which you enter information that leads or points to a file that you want to open. 
   Valid file names include an absolute file name, a file path, and a URL to a remote file, 
   such as /hdf-java-html/hdf5_test.h5.</li>
   
   <li>
   <b><i>Tree panel</i></b><br />
   The Tree panel is the left panel in the HDFView window. It displays the group 
   structure of an HDF file as a tree of &ldquo;folders.&rdquo; Other objects, 
   such as datasets and images, are displayed as leaf objects in the tree.</li>
   
   <li>
   <b><i>Data panel</i></b><br />
   The data panel is the right panel in the HDFView window where the content of data objects is displayed. All
   the data windows are laid out in the data panel. You can display more than one
   document in the data panel.</li>
   
   <li>
   <b><i>Info panel</i></b><br />
   The Info panel is the bottom panel that spans the width of the HDFView window. 
   It displays status information or metadata. Click the tab
   &ldquo;Log Info&rdquo; or the tab &ldquo;Metadata&rdquo; to view status 
   information or metadata information, respectively. A status
   message includes file or data information, warning or error messages and the 
   status of data processing. The Info panel can also be used as a quick way to 
   view metadata of the selected
   object in the tree view when &ldquo;Metadata&rdquo; tab is selected.</li>
   </ul>
   
   <h2>Menu bar</h2>
   <p>
   The Menu bar is at the top of the HDFView window. You can select a menu command
   from menu items or press key combinations from the keyboard to invoke the menu
   item's action without navigating through the menu hierarchy. For example, to exit
   HDFView, you can either press &ldquo;Ctrl+Q&rdquo; on the keyboard or select 
   the &ldquo;Exit&rdquo; item from the &ldquo;File&rdquo; menu.</p>
   
   <p>
   <i><b>File menu</b></i><br />
   The File menu contains commands to open and close files, create and save files, and
   exit HDFView.</p>
   
   <center><p>
   <img src="images/menu_file.gif" />
   <br /><b>File menu</b></p></center>
   
   
   <i><b>Window menu</b></i><br />
   The Window menu displays a list of currently open data windows along with the close, 
   tile, and cascade window commands. You can bring a data window to the front by choosing
   the data name from the Window menu. The &ldquo;Cascade&rdquo; and 
   &ldquo;Tile&rdquo; commands 
   cascade or tile all open windows. The &ldquo;Close&rdquo; command closes the 
   <em>active</em> data window. The &ldquo;Close All&rdquo; command closes 
   all open windows. 
   All open data windows are listed at the bottom of the Window menu. Select 
   one of the items on the list to bring that window to the front.

   <br /><b>Window menu</b></p></center>
   
   
   <p><i><b>Tools menu</b></i><br />
   The Tools menu contains a list of commands to launch tools such as
   image conversion and user options. The &ldquo;User Options&rdquo;
   command launches a dialog box that allows you to change user preferences: 
   the path of the User's Guide, font size, delimiter and more. For more information,
   see <a href="ug08useroptions.html">User Options</a>.</p>

   <img src="images/menu_option.gif" />
   <br /><b>Tools menu</b></p></center>
   
      
   <i><b>Help menu</b></i><br />
   The Help menu displays the User's Guide, the version of the HDF4, HDF5 and Java
   libraries, currently supported file formats and the About box.

   <h2>
   <a name="ug02load"></a>2.2 Opening a File</h2>

   <p>Select the &ldquo;Open&rdquo; command from the file menu or click the 
   &ldquo;Open&rdquo; icon in the tool bar to invoke the local file manager, 
   and select a file to open from the local file manager. Selecting 
   &ldquo;Open Read-Only&rdquo; opens a file with read-only permission, 
   which means that editing functions are disabled and changes are not allowed. By
   default, HDFView will only show files that have a file extension matching those
   specified in the User Options File Extension list (see 
   <a href="ug08useroptions.html#ug08extension">File Extensions</a>), however, the user 
   can click on the drop-down box in the open file dialog box and select "All Files"
   in order to show all files if needed.
   </p>

   <h2>
   <a name="ug02tree"></a>2.3 Tree View of File Hierarchy</h2>
   <p>
   An HDF file contains one or more objects, optionally grouped in a hierarchy.
   For general information about the structure and contents of HDF files,
   see the HDF documentation at
   <a href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/"> HDF5 Documentation</a> and
   <a href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/release4/doc.html"> HDF4 Documentation</a>.</p>
   
   <p>
   The structure of the file is displayed in the Tree panel, which is the left 
   panel in the HDFView window. Data objects are represented as icons, and 
   groups are represented by folders. An HDF file may contain groups, 
   datasets (arrays), committed datatypes, and links.</p>
   
<p>The hierarchy of the file can be navigated by selecting folders to 
   &ldquo;open&rdquo;
   a group, which displays the objects contained by the group. When an object
   is selected (by double clicking the object or by right clicking the object and
   selecting "Open" or "Open As" from the popup menu), the data is displayed 
   appropriately in the data panel on the right.</p>
   
   <p>
   You can open multiple files at one time. Files are listed as root objects
   in the tree. The following figure illustrates that 
   an HDF5 file, hdf5_test.h5, and an HDF4 file, annras.hdf, are currently open. </p>
   
<center>
   <p><img src="images/tree_view.gif" />
   <br /><b>Tree view</b></p></center>
   
   <p>
   You can also search for data objects within a file by right-clicking on the file
   and selecting "Find" from the Context menu. Type in the name of a data object to look
   for and HDFView will highlight the first occurrence of the object within the file. The 
   wildcard '*', which specifies that any number of characters can come after the text before 
   the '*' character, can be used to broaden your search. As an example, searching for 'dataset*'
   will find any objects whose name is a variation on 'dataset', i.e. 'dataset', 
   'dataset_int', 'dataset75', etc.
   
   <h2>

   <a name="ug02message"></a>2.4 Viewing Status Information</h2>
   <p>
   Short status information and feedback messages are displayed in the information 
   panel. Such information includes error messages and feedback from user's 
   actions. Click on the &ldquo;Log Info&rdquo; and &ldquo;Metadata&rdquo; 
   tabs to switch between 
   viewing status information and viewing metadata.</p>
   
<h2>
   <a name="ug02property"></a>2.5 Viewing HDF Metadata</h2>
   <p>
   To see the metadata of a data object, right-click the data object to show the 
   Context Menu for that object. Then, left-click the "Show Properties" menu option 
   to show the Properties dialog box, which displays metadata information such as
   name, type, attributes, datatype, dataspace, and members. If modules are installed
   and available, the metadata of an object can be displayed in a different manner
   by selecting the "Show Properties As" option from the Context Menu instead.</p>

   <p>
   To view a user block in text, right-click the file node (the root group) 
   and open the Properties dialog box. Click the &ldquo;User Block&rdquo; tab in the 
   dialog box to show the user block information in text.</p>
